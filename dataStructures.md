###Data structures
- arrays
- vectors
- linked lists
- hashtables
- trees
- graphs

###Should be able to describe, for any of the data structures above
- what you use them for (real-life examples)
- why you prefer them for those examples
- the operations they typically provide (e.g. insert, delete, find)
- the big-O performance of those operations (e.g. logarithmic, exponential)
- how you traverse them to visit all their elements, and what order they're visited in
- at least one typical implementation for the data structure
